#  Airline Delay Analysis (2013–2023)

## About the Project
This project explores flight delay trends in the U.S. aviation industry over a 10-year period, analyzing key factors behind delays and cancellations. Inspired by a Newsweek article highlighting the most delayed airports in the U.S., the goal was to uncover real, data-backed insights using storytelling techniques and visualizations.

## A Passionate Data Storyteller
I am a data storyteller who believes that behind every dataset lies a compelling story waiting to be told.  
Through this project, I’ve combined data analytics and visual storytelling using Tableau to:
- Discover hidden patterns
- Make airline performance transparent
- Deliver clear, engaging insights to the audience

## Main Questions Explored
- Which airlines have the worst delay records over the years?
- Which airports consistently experience the most delays?
- What are the key reasons behind flight delays?
- Is there a strong relationship between delays and cancellations?
- When are delays at their highest throughout the year?

## Tools Used
- **Tableau** – For interactive dashboards and storytelling
- **Excel** – For data cleaning and preparation
- **Git** – For version control and project sharing
